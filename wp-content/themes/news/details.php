                        I will travel to Japan later this month. I’ve been going there since the 1980s, and it is one of
                        my favorite countries to visit. But this trip will be different from every other trip I have
                        taken, because it is taking place in the shadow of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s horrifying
                        death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was fortunate to meet with the prime minister several times, most recently in 2015, and to
                        exchange letters with him as well. He enjoyed good conversation and had thoughtful views on
                        everything from revitalizing Japan’s economy to international cooperation to empowering women.
                        We shared an appreciation for the innovations that came out of the Japanese computer industry,
                        and he often spoke about how he wanted to foster even more.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Most of all, though, we shared an appreciation for Japan’s leading role in improving health and
                        saving lives around the world. Prime Minister Abe was a reliable champion for supporting the
                        efforts of low- and middle-income countries. He was proud of what Japan has accomplished.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        During his tenure, the prime minister inspired the world to focus its attention on global
                        health, and Japan set an example by increasing its own support for a wide range of lifesaving
                        projects. As the host of the G7 meeting in 2016, he ensured that health stayed on the global
                        agenda, persuading world leaders to call for the end of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and
                        expanding Japan’s funding for that work.

                        When he was prime minister, Japan doubled its support
                        for making sure that children everywhere get routine vaccines. He was a strong advocate for
                        eradicating polio. And under his leadership, Japan helped launch a global effort to develop
                        vaccines that will prevent pandemics and became its top donor.
